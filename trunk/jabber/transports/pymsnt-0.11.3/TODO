I'm hoping that 0.12 will be a quick release, so if I don't have time
to do some of these things, they may get dropped. The first 5 are
definites though. The last ones shouldn't take too long, so they will
most likely get done also.

I'll be merging changes into trunk as they become stable.


For 0.12:
* Clean up MSNConnection
* Connect Session and MSNConnection with sigslot, so I can worry less
  about managing references
* Make ReconnectingClientFactory behave properly
* Separate the all the removeMe methods into two parts. def removeMe(self):
  will set about the destruction of the object, but will not free any
  resources. def removed(self): will be called when it is safe to free
  resources. This should clean the code up a lot, and make it work better.
* Avatar sending with JEP-0008
* On login failure, respond with presence error, not a message error
* Steal infodump.py from Daniel
* Handle adding bad contacts with a presence error reply
* Password obscuring in xdb
* Make sure everything runs fine under Psyco


For 0.13:
* epoll installer (point & shoot)
* Twisted installer, eg run ./getTwisted.py and you suddenly have
  a known-good version of Twisted and epoll installed in your PyMSNt
  directory.
* Port to new (not yet existing) Jabber library, based on Twisted
* PEP nicks
* PEP avatars
* Chatstates
* Steal XDB and language code from Daniel
* More adhoc commands
