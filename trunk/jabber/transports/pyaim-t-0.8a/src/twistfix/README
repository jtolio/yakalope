Twistfix
--------

Normalises different versions so that they behave the same as Twisted 2.2
Note, this only normalises some behaviour, not all. Just enough for
PyMSNt to work.

To use, copy twistfix into your project (or PYTHONPATH), and before you
import any twisted modules, run
>> import twistfix
>> twistfix.main()
This should only be done once.
