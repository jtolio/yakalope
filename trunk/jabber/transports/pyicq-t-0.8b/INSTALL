More thorough install/configuration documents are available at:

There's really not much to the install at the moment.  It's important
to make sure you have the following installed:

- Jabber ;D

- Python
Python (>= 2.2.0)               http://www.python.org/

- Twisted (www.twistedmatrix.com)

  Twisted 1.0 Based:
     Twisted 1.3.0                   http://twistedmatrix.com/products/download

     PLEASE NOTE: The web interface no longer works with Twisted 1.*.

  Twisted 2.0 Based:
     Note: You can dodge most of this by installing TwistedSumo, which contains
           all of the below and then some, including a copy of Zope Interface.
     Zope Interface (>= 3.0.1)       http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface
     [ or ZopeX3 (>= 3.0.0c1)        http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeX3 ]
     Twisted (>= 2.0.0)              http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/
     TwistedWeb (>= 0.5.0)           http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/
     TwistedWords (>= 0.1.0)         http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/words/
     TwistedXish (>= 0.1.0)          http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish/

     - Optional: nevow (http://www.nevow.org/) for web interface
     nevow (>= 0.4.1)                http://www.nevow.org/

- Optional: epoll for epoll reactor choice
     epoll (>= 0.4)       http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/?page=downloads

- Optional: python mysql interface for mysql xdb backend
     mysql-python (>= 1.0.0)       http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

Then, in the same directory as this INSTALL, copy config_example.xml to
config.xml and edit config.xml.  Change the jid to the Jabber ID you want
this transport to answer as.  Change mainServer to the IP address or DNS
name of your Jabber server.  Change secret to the shared secret between
transports and your Jabber server (should be in router.xml for Jabberd2).
Change port to the port this transport is to connect to (also found in
router.xml for Jabberd2).  Edit other options at your leisure, they are
fairly self-documented.

If you are migrating from JIT, you can copy over your spol directory into
the same directory that this INSTALL file is.  (make sure the jid field
is set to the same name as this spool directory)  If you are
starting a fresh spool directory, simply mkdir the same name you used
in the jid field.  Note that you can set the actual location of the spool
directory if you want, instead of having to put it in this directory.  If
you want PyICQ to retain backwards compatibility with the C-based
aim-transport, make sure to set xdbDriver to legacyaimtransport.  If you want
PyICQ to retain backwards compatibility with JIT, make sure to set xdbDriver
to legacyjittransport.  You may also want to look at the migrate.py script
in the tools.  It can convert between various spool formats in case you get
stuck.

With Jabberd2, there's little else you need to do than run PyICQt in this
directory.  It's important to know that you should -not- have an alias
line in your router.xml for PyICQ-t's main jid.  You will probably want to
create a user for the transport to authenticate as (using SASL) in your
roster-users.xml file, and give that user bind access in sm.xml.  Set
the user as saslUser in your config file and secret will be used as the
password.  At that point, the transport will use Jabberd2's own component
protocol to identify itself as every JID it's expecting to take care of.
Be sure to also enable useJ2Component so that the transport properly
binds as all of it's JIDs.

Note: the following instructions are provided almost word for word from
James Bunton, just modified for ICQ.  ;)

With Jabberd1, you need to add something like the following to jabber.xml:
<service id="icq.host.com">
	<host>icq.host.com</host>
	<accept>
		<ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
		<port>XXXX</port>
		<secret>secret</secret>
	</accept>
</service>

Check that icq.host.com is the same as the 'jid' setting from config.xml
and that XXXX is the same as the 'port' setting.  Also 'secret' must
correspond, and the 'mainServer' setting should be pointing to the same
interface as the <ip/> tag is (in this example the loopback interface is
used. So 'mainServer' would be '127.0.0.1').

You must also add this to the browse section of your jabber.xml file

<service type="icq" jid="icq.host.com" name="ICQ Transport">
	<ns>jabber:iq:register</ns>
</service>

Once again, icq.host.com must correspond to the 'jid' setting in config.xml

Once you have made all these changes, restart your Jabberd1.4.x server,
then start PyICQt and it should all work.

Note that the documentation on the web site is sometimes a tad more
thorough, so you will want to look at http://pyicqt.googlecode.com/.
