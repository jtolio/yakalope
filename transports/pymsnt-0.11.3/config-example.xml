<!-- This file contains options to be configured by the server administrator. -->
<!-- Please read through all the options in this file -->

<!-- The JabberID of the transport -->
<jid>msn</jid>
<!-- The public IP or DNS name of the machine the transport is running on -->
<!-- This is needed for file transfer!! This is also used as the IP address for outgoing connections -->
<host>127.0.0.1</host>
<!-- The component JID of the transport. Unless you're doing clustering, leave this alone -->
<!-- <compjid>msn1</compjid> -->
<!-- The name of the transport in the service discovery list. -->
<!-- <discoName>MSN Transport</discoName> -->


<!-- The location of the spool directory.. if relative, relative to the PyMSNt dir.
Do not include the jid of the transport -->
<!-- <spooldir>/path/to/data</spooldir> -->
<!-- The location of the PID file, relative to the PyMSNt directory -->
<pid>PyMSNt.pid</pid>
<!-- If set, the transport will background itself when run -->
<background/>
<!-- The Twisted reactor to choose. Pick poll or epoll on Linux, kqueue on BSD. Or leave as default (best found) -->
<!-- <reactor>poll</reactor> -->


<!-- The IP address of the main Jabber server to connect to -->
<mainServer>127.0.0.1</mainServer>
<!-- The TCP port to connect to the Jabber server on (this is the default for Jabberd2) -->
<port>5347</port>
<!-- The authentication token to use when connecting to the Jabber server -->
<secret>secret</secret>
<!-- Use Jabber.com's XCP component protocol extensions. --> 
<!-- <useXCP/> -->


<!-- The default language to use -->
<lang>en</lang>
<!-- The website of the Jabber service -->
<website>http://host.com</website>


<!-- Comment out the following options to disable them, or uncomment them to enable them -->
<!-- Send email notification messages to users -->
<mailNotifications/>
<!-- Send greeting on login -->
<!-- <sessionGreeting>You have just started a session with PyMSNt</sessionGreeting> -->
<!-- Send message on successful registration -->
<!-- <registerMessage>You have successfully registered with PyMSNt</registerMessage> -->
<!-- Allow users to register with this transport -->
<allowRegister/>
<!-- Get all avatars. If this is set to true then avatars are grabbed for all your contacts immediately. If false then avatars are only grabbed when you're in a chat with a contact -->
<getAllAvatars/>
<!-- The amount of time a user has to join a groupchat they are invited to before the transport makes them leave the room. (MSN protocol requires autojoining of groupchats) -->
<!-- <groupchatTimeout>120</groupchatTimeout> -->


<!-- File transfer settings -->
<!-- The maximum size of a file transfer (in bytes). For unlimited, comment out, or set to 0 -->
<ftSizeLimit>524288</ftSizeLimit>
<!-- The maximum rate for file transfer (in bytes). For unlimited, comment out, or set to 0 -->
<ftRateLimit>2048</ftRateLimit>
<!-- Please give the port to listen for Jabber socks5 transfers on. -->
<ftJabberPort>8010</ftJabberPort>
<!-- Please give the port to listen for HTTP GETs here (Used in old-style OOB file transfers. Best to leave this disabled unless you know you need it.) -->
<!--<ftOOBPort>8011</ftOOBPort>-->
<!-- Please give the root URL the transport should send to clients. (You can use an Apache reverse proxy to put this on your ordinary website) -->
<!-- Eg, the transport will listen on port 8011 for HTTP GETs to /RANDOM_FILE.ext. You can set apache to forward any requests to http://yourhost.com:80/msn/files/RANDOM_FILE.ext to http://yourhost.com:8011/RANDOM_FILE.ext. This saves you from opening extra ports. -->
<!--<ftOOBRoot>http://host.com/msn/files/</ftOOBRoot>-->

0 -> No logging
1 -> Log tracebacks
