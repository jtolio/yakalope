Daniel Henninger:
All plugin pieces to interact with ICQ.

James Bunton:
Created all of the base Jabber code and made it wonderfully pluggable enough
to adopt to other protocols.  =)

Also, thanks to:
Paul Clegg for helping me figure out how to make use of some of the oscar
functionality, and for his initial discussions with the Twisted Matrix team.

Jonas Adahl for pointing out an endian issue and providing a patch.  Also
for enhancing ICQ user information retrieval (vcard) and adding support
for more accurate user status.  Also for repairing the SSI handling mechanisms!

Magnus Henoch for discovering and fixing the problem with interaction
with ejabberd.

Jonas and Magnus combined for adding support for ICQ nicknames.

Serge Trylis for adding encoding configuration support.

Chris Carlin for adding rate limiting support.

Daniel Chandran for adding socks5 support.

Martin von Loewis for supplying xmlify function.

Maarten Fonville for his wonderful PyICQ login/icon, as well as
James Bunton and the people of Psi, of whose work the icon was based on.

TheTofu (Christopher Zorn) for his XMPP authenticator code from palaver.

Scott Dial for stability improvements and OSCAR protocol patches.

The Twisted Matrix development team who have put together this wonderful
framework we are making use of.  =)  I'd like to especially thank
Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com> for his work on the oscar.py piece and
for working with me to get various pieces working correctly!

Any everyone else who has submitted bug reports, feature requests, patches,
or otherwise helped in the process of developing this or has simply
enjoyed using it.  =)
